			<h2> What is my end goal?</h2>
			<p>		 My end goal is to teach people how to become more familiar with things they use everyday, and to make their lives easier. 
			I want to provide practical solutions to modern issues. I want my solutions to be easy and practical for anyone.
			</p>
			<p>I want to be involved with a team that is also motivated to find solutions to issues. Being a part of a team could help me further feel more useful to the cause. I probably wouldnt even want anything in return.</p>
		<strong> What is the first step I can take? </strong>
		
		<p>		I really would just like to get my name out there. I will continue building up my skills and expirences through continuing to help people and my current job. I will take any opportunity I am presented with 
		to enhance my skills and understanding of what intrests me. Hopefully in the future I will have ever more solutions to provide for people.</p>
