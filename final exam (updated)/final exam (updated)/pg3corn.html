			<h2>basic definition</h2>
			<p>E85 is like any other fuel, however it is diluted with ethanol. The 'E' in E85 stands for ethanol. So if you have E85, that means 85% of the fuel is ethanol and 15% is normal gasoline. 
	`			What this does is substantially increase the fuel's resistance to detonation. This means that the engine can extract much more energy from the fuel compared to gasoline. This also means that the fuel doesn't get as hot after it is burned. This causes it to be more dense—extracting even more energy and burning more completely.
				Since it burns more completely, less of it gets wasted as heat or exhaust.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Since the detonation is so much higher (estimated 110 octane compared to normal gasoline), you are able to crank out a lot more ignition timing out of an EFI engine. If you aren't familiar with what octane ratings are, it
			is the unit of measurement for fuel's resistance to combustion. That means that the fuel won't pre-combust and cause something called detonation. Detonation is a process in which the fuel already detonates (explodes) before the combustion cycle can finish. This can be really harmful for engines
			and wastes a lot of energy. A lot of this energy ends up just going into the atmosphere as hydrocarbons that are unburned. This is due to having low octane fuels with inefficient engines (literally every new car being made). E85 is extremely knock resistant and almost all of the energy within that fuel
			is extracted in an efficient manner. E85 also burns up to 60 percent more hydrocarbons that harm our environment. This is good because not only does it offset harmful emissions, but they also emit less carbon dioxide.</p>

			<p>Theoretically, if E85 vehicles already burn 60–80% more hydrocarbons compared to normal gasoline cars, then that would negate the need for catalytic converters. Catalytic converters (and DPFs for diesel vehicles) are devices that act as little catalysts that are intended to burn these hydrocarbons down.
			These devices are usually extremely restrictive on ICE engines, and in some cases, can make them run very inefficient. And because of that, some cars end up offsetting their 'reduced' emissions by requiring more fuel and energy to perform the same task. E85 vehicles theoretically wouldn't need cat-converters because they 
			basically already do the job of a cat in the combustion chamber. And without a cat, the engine would have the potential to run much more efficiently. Saving fuel, more horsepower and torque, quieter operation, longer range—those are all benefits you can see with removing a cat on a normal gasoline car. 
			The benefits would be (in theory) much more substantial on an E85 car.</p>

			<h2>
			How is Flex Fuel made? 
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>It can be made in a lot of different ways. The most common way involves using agricultural waste (yes, literally waste that is already going to be burned or destroyed). The process involves extracting the ethanol content from various plant material. 
			This is incredible because the mixture only contains 15 percent of regular gas. Although the practices involved in getting that gas to make E85 still burn fossil fuels, we would still only need to set aside 15% of the fuel we would normally need in order to make a reliable fuel source (gasoline).
			This could be an absolute game changer for the planet if we could halt making 85% of petroleum for gasoline and use CORN.</p>
