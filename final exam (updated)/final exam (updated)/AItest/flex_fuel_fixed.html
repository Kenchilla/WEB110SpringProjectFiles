            <h2>We need change</h2>
            <p>The government thought it was a brilliant idea to continue to mine ultra rare metals. But if the planet is already as far gone as it is, Why don't we just use what we have?</p>

            <h2>Flex Fuel</h2>
            <p>One thing we already have is 'FlexFuel'. This fuel source has already proven itself effective in many applications.</p>

            <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
            <p>Flex fuel can literally be added on to any efi (electronic fuel injection) vehicle and the fuel itself burns up to 50% cleaner than gasoline. </p>

        <h1>What's the catch?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Though they are minuscule, there are a couple downsides involving flexfuel as a whole. Arguably the benefits far outweigh the caveats.</p>
