Just spread awareness. A lot of people see things like "flex fuel" on fuel pumps and think nothing of it. If people were aware of how much potential
it could have to substantially reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emitted, we would be in a much better situation. If we mandated something like this for all cars that came out, that would give us the time needed 
to get our infrastructure in order. This new energy conservation could offset any harmful environmental factors that we could potentially introduce while updating our infrastructure.

If you would like to get involved and help people become educated with these solutionsâ€”as well as put some of these solutions into practice, then sign up for our newsletter. With this, you can become
more informed about the current state of Flex Fuel as well as find good deals on kits that are plug and play. If you REALLY want to help, we will send you a flex fuel kit with all of the necessary programming and hardware.
