			<h2>It's already being done</h2>
			<p>Fully fledged E85 kits are on the market. Some of them are a couple hundred dollars while some are substantially more expensive. All these kits have one thing in common--They are able to be installed on almost every single car that is newer than 2004.
			Though it's not likely, a really easy and painless solution would be to mandate vehicles having some sort of flex-fuel capability. Whether that being a requirement to take your car in and have a kit installed, or just sending out free kits to install. The fact is every car can run this stuff.
			Auto manufacturers could also only run E85 on their vehicles. All newer cars that would be bought would barely contribute to the environmental crisis.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Man that just sounds too good to be true... Is it?</h2>
			<p>All evidence says no. The only real downside about this fuel source is how cold it burns. ICE engines like to be nice and warm. Fun fact, most of the wear on a vehicle's engine happens because of cold starts. When a cold engine is running, that fuel isn't combusting as efficiently. This 
			is why most vehicles run in a closed loop on cold starts (But that's a whole other subject). E85 vehicles are also notoriously hard to start in the winter. Because that fuel is so resistant, flammable substances naturally become more resistant when they are extremely cold. Fire likes heat. 
			Engines are basically chambers for fire, so when there's no heat, the fire has trouble staying 'lit'. This is why these cars can sometimes run like crap in colder climates.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This issue can be mitigated by using a more harsh blend of gasoline and ethanol. For example, there are blends like E10 and E40 specifically designed to combat this caveat. Though they won't be as 'clean' as E85, they are still measurably cleaner than standard gasoline.</p>
