			<h2>Electric power</h2>
			<p>To anyone, this sounds like a grand solution. Electric cars have no emissions--therefore making them harmless to the environment. Though that sounds right, that is just not the case. The electric energy to power these vehicles is harvested from non-renewable sources (at least most of it is). 
			And 90 percent of those sources end up damaging our environment even further. This is nowhere near good.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>Another damaging factor involves the actual process in creating the batteries. The equipment used literally destroys the earth--in an irreversible way.</p>
		<br>
			
			
		<h2><strong>What about diesel?</strong></h2>
			<p>Sometime ago, diesel was advertised as a 'Clean' fuel source. However, this simply isn't the case. Yes, diesel may produce more energy per combustion cycleâ€”which results in being able to travel further. However, the pollution from diesel is much worse than gasoline.</p>

			<h3>So its really that bad?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Our infrastructure also just doesn't allow for that type of change. Attempting to make the entire US run on electric vehicles is just unattainable. It would take literal years to make it doable.
I'm not saying it isn't possible in the future. The real solution actually would be to be fully electric with renewable energy. But we need something to address this issue now.</p>
