			<h2>Electric power</h2>
			<p>To anyone, this sounds like a grand solution. Electric cars have no emissions--therefore making them harmless to the environment. Though that sounds right, that is just not the case. The electric energy to power these vehicles is harvested from non-renewable sources (at least most of it is). And 90 percent of those sources end up damaging our environment even further. This is nowhere near good.</p>
			<p>Another damaging factor involves the actual process in creating the batteries. The equipment used literally destroys the earth--in an irreversible way.</p>
			<p>I want to be involved with a team that is also motivated to find solutions to issues. Being a part of a team could help me further feel more useful to the cause. I probably wouldn’t even want anything in return.</p>
			
			<strong>What about diesel?</strong>
			<p>Sometime ago, diesel was advertised as a 'Clean' fuel source. However, this simply isn't the case. Yes, diesel may produce more energy per combustion cycle—which results in being able to travel further. However, the pollution from diesel is much worse than gasoline.</p>
